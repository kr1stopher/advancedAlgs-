Repository focusing on algorithms related to stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.


stackqueue.cpp:
Contents:
	(1) Use a single array to implement 3 stacks 
	(2) Stack class using nodes
	(3) setOfStacks - class that uses multiple stacks with a max capacity for each 
	(3) arrayStack, turns an array into a stack 
	(4)myQueue, uses two stacks to implement a queue 
	(5)stackSort - sorts a stack using only one additional stack and a temp variable 


treesgraphs.cpp
	(1) node class
	(2) binarySearchTree class 
		insert, remove, and print functions
	(3) Graph class
	(4) isBalanced (check to see if a binarySearchTree is balanced)
	(5) isPath (check to see if there is a path between two nodes) 
	(6) buildTree
	(6) buildTree1 //build binary search tree of min height given an array of ordered int values 
	(7)treeDepth //returns depth of a tree
	(8) linkedTree (binaryTree myTree) // returns a vector of linked lists, one list for each level in the tree containing all of that levels' nodes 
	(8) isSearch //check to see if a given binary tree is a binary search tree
