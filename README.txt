Repository focusing on algorithms related to stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.


stackqueue.cpp:
Contents:
	(1) Use a single array to implement 3 stacks 
	(2) Stack class using nodes
	(3) setOfStacks - class that uses multiple stacks with a max capacity for each 
	(3) arrayStack, turns an array into a stack 
	(4)myQueue, uses two stacks to implement a queue 
	(5)stackSort - sorts a stack using only one additional stack and a temp variable 


treesgraphs.cpp
	(1) node class
	(2) binarySearchTree class 
	(3) Graph class
	(4) isBalanced (check to see if a binarySearchTree is balanced)
	(5) isPath (check to see if there is a path between two nodes)
